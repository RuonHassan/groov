## Core Features

### 1. Task Management

Tasks in the application follow the GTD methodology with the following statuses:

- **Inbox**: New, uncategorized tasks
- **Next**: Tasks ready to be worked on
- **Waiting**: Tasks pending someone else's action
- **Someday**: Tasks to be considered in the future
- **Projects**: Multi-step tasks
- **Completed**: Finished tasks

Tasks contain the following properties:
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `title`: Task name
- `notes`: Additional information
- `status`: Current state (inbox/next/waiting/etc.)
- `context`: Environment or tool needed (e.g., home, computer)
- `energy`: Energy level required (high/medium/low)
- `priority`: Importance level (high/medium/low)
- `time`: Estimated time in minutes
- `dueDate`: Optional deadline
- `completedAt`: Completion timestamp
- `createdAt`: Creation timestamp

#### Task Organization

Tasks are automatically organized into temporal sections:
- **Today**: Tasks due today
- **Tomorrow**: Tasks due tomorrow
- **Future**: Tasks with due dates beyond tomorrow or no due date
- **Someday**: Tasks marked for future consideration

Each section provides:
- Clear section headers with prominent styling
- Task cards showing task details and actions
- Quick-add functionality for Today and Tomorrow sections
  - One-click "Add task" button when section is empty
  - Instant task creation with title input and Enter key
